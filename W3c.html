        <p>
            Short for World Wide Web Consortium, an international consortium of companies involved with the Internet and
            the Web. The W3C was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, the original architect of the World Wide Web. The
            organization's purpose is to develop open standards so that the Web evolves in a single direction rather
            than being splintered among competing factions.
        </p>
        <h5><strong>History of W3C</strong></h5><br>
        <p>
            <strong>March 1989</strong> : “Information Management: A Proposal” written by Tim Berners-Lee (TBL) and
            circulated for comments at CERN.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>October 1990</strong> : TBL starts work on a hypertext GUI browser+editor using the NeXTStep
            development environment. He makes up “WorldWideWeb” as a name for the program and project.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>August 1991</strong> : Web software made available on the Internet via FTP.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>May 1992</strong> : Pei Wei’s “Viola” GUI browser for X test version.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>February 1993</strong> : National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) release first alpha
            version of Marc Andreessen’s “Mosaic for X”.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>April 1993</strong> : CERN’s declares that WWW technology would be freely usable by anyone, with no
            fees being payable to CERN.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>May 1994</strong> : First International WWW Conference, CERN, Geneva.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>October 1994</strong> : World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) founded.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><strong>What is the importance of W3C?</strong></h5>
        <p>
            Back in the “old days,” the Internet was a lot like the Wild West. There were few standards for coding, page
            design, and browser compatibility. Many different web browsers vied for market dominance. And with the lack
            of standards, most websites did not work well with all browsers. If you needed information from a web site
            that didn’t work on your browser, you either had to buy a different browser or get that information
            elsewhere.<br>

            Fortunately, along came the Word Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to bring some law and order to the wild
            cyber-frontier. Created in 1994, W3C is an international community of member organizations that articulates
            web standards so that websites look and work the same in all web browsers. Its mission is to lead the World
            Wide Web to its full potential by developing standards, protocols and guidelines that ensure its long-term
            growth.<br>

            To achieve its mission, W3C employs a full-time staff that works with the public to make the web accessible
            to all users despite differences in culture, education, ability, resources, and physical limitations. W3C
            also coordinates its work with other standards organizations such as the Internet Engineering Task Force,
            the Wireless Application Protocols (WAP) Forum, and the Unicode Consortium. W3C receives funding through
            research grants, individual donations of money and equipment, and other sources of private and public
            funding. W3C’s primary focus is developing protocols and guidelines for key aspects of the web ranging from
            HTML and CSS coding to web architecture, XLM technology, web devices, and web browsing and authoring tools.
            W3C standard technologies are downloadable at no cost, maintained in a predictable fashion, and strengthened
            through rigorous interoperability testing. Conversely, websites that don’t use W3C protocols will be slow to
            load, which can frustrate visitors. They won’t work well with all browsers, which could eliminate many
            potential viewers. And they won’t work as efficiently with search engines, which could lower search rankings
            and make it harder for people to find the site. W3C standards are the primary reason the web works so well
            today and will work even better in the future. They’re good for web designers and for web users, and should
            be an integral part of every web design project.
