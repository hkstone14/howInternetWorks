        <h1>Network Packets</h1>
        <p>Packets are modest-sized buffers of data, transmitted as a unit through some shared set of links. Of
            necessity,
            packets need to be prefixed with a header containing delivery information. In the common case known as
            datagram forwarding, the header contains a destination address; headers in networks using so-called
            virtual-circuit forwarding contain instead an identifier for the connection. Almost all networking today is
            packet-based.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each packet is then sent off to its destination by the best available route -- a route that might be taken
            by all the other packets in the message or by none of the other packets in the message. This makes the
            network more efficient. First, the network can balance the load across various pieces of equipment on a
            millisecond-by-millisecond basis. Second, if there is a problem with one piece of equipment in the network
            while a message is being transferred, packets can be routed around the problem, ensuring the delivery of the
            entire message
        </p>
        <h4>Structure of Packet</h4>

        <br>
        <h5><strong>Header</strong></h5>
        <p>
            The header contains instructions about the data carried by the packet.These may contains length of
            packet,packet number,protocol,destination address and origination address.<br>
            <strong>1. Length of Packet</strong><br>
            Some networks have fixed-length packets, while others rely on the header to contain this information.<br>
            <strong>2. Synchronization</strong><br>
            Few bits that help the packet match up to the network.<br>
            <strong>3. Packet Number</strong><br>
            It is the number which identifies packet uniquely.<br>
            <strong>4. Protocol</strong><br>
            The protocol defines what type of packet is being transmitted: e-mail, Web page, streaming video.<br>
            <strong>5. Payload</strong><br>
            Also called the body or data of a packet. This is the actual data that the packet is delivering to the
            destination. If a packet is fixed-length, then the payload may be padded with blank information to make it
            the right size.<br>
            <strong>6. Trailer</strong><br>
            The trailer, sometimes called the footer, typically contains a couple of bits that tell the receiving device
            that it has reached the end of the packet. It may also have some type of error checking. The most common
            error checking used in packets is Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC).<br>
        </p>
        <h5><strong>Example</strong></h5>
        <p>
            Let's say that you send an e-mail to a friend. The e-mail is about 4,000 bits (4 kilobits) in size. The
            network you send it over uses fixed-length packets of 1,024 bits (1 kilobit). The header of each packet is
            96 bits long and the trailer is 32 bits long, leaving 896 bits for the payload. To break the 4,000 bits of
            message into packets, you will need four packets (divide 4,000 by 896). Four packets will contain 896 bits
            of payload and the fifth will have 416 bits. Here is what one of the four packets would contain:

            Each packet's header will contain the proper protocols, the originating address (the IP address of your
            computer), the destination address (the IP address of the computer where you are sending the e-mail) and the
            packet number.

        <h1>Network Routing</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Network routing is the process of selecting a path across one or more networks. The principles of routing
            can apply to any type of network, from telephone networks to public transportation. In packet-switching
            networks, such as the Internet, routing selects the paths for Internet Protocol (IP) packets to travel from
            their origin to their destination. These Internet routing decisions are made by specialized pieces of
            network hardware called routers
        </p>
        <h5><strong>How does routing work?</strong></h5>
        <p>
            Routers refer to internal routing tables to make decisions about how to route packets along network paths. A
            routing table records the paths that packets should take to reach every destination that the router is
            responsible for. Think of train timetables, which train passengers consult to decide which train to catch.
            Routing tables are like that, but for network paths rather than trains.</p>

        <p>Routers work in the following way: when a router receives a packet, it reads the headers of the packet to
            see its intended destination, like the way a train conductor may check a passenger's tickets to determine
            which train they should go on. It then determines where to route the packet based on information in its
            routing tables.</p>

        <p>Routers do this millions of times a second with millions of packets. As a packet travels to its destination,
            it may be routed several times by different routers.</p>

        <p>Routing tables can either be static or dynamic. Static routing tables do not change. A network administrator
            manually sets up static routing tables. This essentially sets in stone the routes data packets take across
            the network, unless the administrator manually updates the tables.</p>

        <p>Dynamic routing tables update automatically. Dynamic routers use various routing protocols (see below) to
            determine the shortest and fastest paths. They also make this determination based on how long it takes
            packets to reach their destination — similar to the way Google Maps, Waze, and other GPS services determine
            the best driving routes based on past driving performance and current driving conditions.

            Dynamic routing requires more computing power, which is why smaller networks may rely on static routing. But
            for medium-sized and large networks, dynamic routing is much more efficient.
