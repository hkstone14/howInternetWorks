        <h1>IP Address</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            IP stands for Internet Protocol and describes a set of standards and requirements for creating and
            transmitting data packets, or datagrams, across networks. The Internet Protocol (IP) is part of the Internet
            layer of the Internet protocol suite. In the OSI model, IP would be considered part of the network layer. IP
            is traditionally used in conjunction with a higher-level protocol, most notably TCP. The IP standard is
            governed by RFC 791.
        </p>
        <h5>How IP address works?</h5>
        <p>
            An IP address allows computers to send and receive data over the internet. Most IP addresses are purely
            numerical, but as internet usage grows, letters have been added to some addresses.<br>

            IP is designed to work over a dynamic network. This means that IP must work without a central directory or
            monitor, and that it cannot rely upon specific links or nodes existing. IP is a connectionless protocol that
            is datagram-oriented., so each packet must contain the source IP address, destination IP address, and other
            data in the header to be successfully delivered.<br>

            Combined, these factors make IP an unreliable, best effort delivery protocol. Error correction is handled by
            upper level protocols instead. These protocols include TCP, which is a connection-oriented protocol, and
            UDP, which is a connectionless protocol.Most internet traffic is TCP/IP.<br>
        </p>
        <h6>Example:</h6>
        <p>
            An IP address can be compared to a Social Security Number (SSN) since each one is completely unique to the
            computer or user it is assigned to. The creation of these numbers allows routers to identify where they are
            sending information on the internet. They also make sure that the correct devices are receiving what is
            being sent. Much like the post office needs a mailing address to deliver a package, a router needs an IP
            address to deliver to the web address requested.
        </p>
        <h5>IP Versions</h5>
        <p>
            There are two versions of IP in use today, IPv4 and IPv6. The original IPv4 protocol is still used today on
            both the internet, and many corporate networks. However, the IPv4 protocol only allowed for 232 addresses.
            This, coupled with how addresses were allocated, led to a situation where there would not be enough unique
            addresses for all devices connected to the internet.
        <h6>IPv6</h6>
        IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and was formalized in 1998. This upgrade
        substantially increased the available address space and allowed for 2128 addresses. In addition, there were
        changes to improve the efficiency of IP packet headers, as well as improvements to routing and security.
        <h6>IPv4</h6>
        IPv4 addresses are actually 32-bit binary numbers, consisting of the two subaddresses (identifiers)
        mentioned above which, respectively, identify the network and the host to the network, with an imaginary
        boundary separating the two. An IP address is, as such, generally shown as 4 octets of numbers from 0-255
        represented in decimal form instead of binary form.

        For example, the address 168.212.226.204 represents the 32-bit binary number
        10101000.11010100.11100010.11001100.

        The binary number is important because that will determine which class of network the IP address belongs to.


        An IPv4 address is typically expressed in dotted-decimal notation, with every eight bits (octet) represented
        by a number from one to 255, each separated by a dot. An example IPv4 address would look like this:
        <strong>192.168.16.47</strong><br>
        IPv4 addresses are composed of two parts. The first numbers in the address specify the network, while the latter
        numbers specify the specific host. A subnet mask specifies which part of an address is the network part, and
        which part addresses the specific host.<br>
