        <h1>HTML</h1>
        <hr>
        <h5><strong> What is HTML?</strong></h5>
        <p>
            Short for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>, the authoring language used to create documents on the
            World Wide Web.
            HTML is similar to SGML, although it is not a strict subset.

            HTML defines the structure and layout of a Web document by using a variety of tags and attributes. The
            correct
            structure for an HTML document starts with
        <div style="font-size: 20px"><strong><code>
            <xmp>
                <HTML>
                <HEAD>(enter here what document is about)
                <BODY> and ends with</BODY>
                </HTML>
                All the information you'd like to include in your Web page fits in between the
                <BODY> and</BODY>
            </xmp>
        </code></strong></div>
        tags.

        There are hundreds of other tags used to format and layout the information in a Web page. Tags are also used
        to
        specify hypertext links. These allow Web developers to direct users to other Web pages with only a click of
        the
        mouse on either an image or word(s).
        </p>
        <h5><strong>History of HTML</strong></h5>
        <p>
            "For its first five years (1990-1995), HTML went through a number of revisions and experienced a number of
            extensions, primarily hosted first at CERN, and then at the IETF.<br>

            With the creation of the W3C, HTML's development changed venue again. A first abortive attempt at extending
            HTML in 1995 known as HTML 3.0 then made way to a more pragmatic approach known as HTML 3.2, which was
            completed in 1997. HTML4 followed, reaching completion in 1998.<br>

            At this time, the W3C membership decided to stop evolving HTML and instead begin work on an XML-based
            equivalent, called XHTML. This effort started with a reformulation of HTML4 in XML, known as XHTML 1.0,
            which added no new features except the new serialization, and which was completed in 2000. After XHTML 1.0,
            the W3C's focus turned to making it easier for other working groups to extend XHTML, under the banner of
            XHTML Modularization. In parallel with this, the W3C also worked on a new language that was not compatible
            with the earlier HTML and XHTML languages, calling it XHTML2.<br>

            Around the time that HTML's evolution was stopped in 1998, parts of the API for HTML developed by browser
            vendors were specified and published under the name DOM Level 1 (in 1998) and DOM Level 2 Core and DOM Level
            2 HTML (starting in 2000 and culminating in 2003). These efforts then petered out, with some DOM Level 3
            specifications published in 2004 but the working group being closed before all the Level 3 drafts were
            completed.

        <h5><strong>What is CSS?</strong></h5>
        <p>
            Stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheet</strong>. Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages. They
            can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be
            defined in a page's HTML.<br>

            CSS helps Web developers create a uniform look across several pages of a Web site. Instead of defining the
            style of each table and each block of text within a page's HTML, commonly used styles need to be defined
            only once in a CSS document. Once the style is defined in cascading style sheet, it can be used by any page
            that references the CSS file. Plus, CSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages at once. For
            example, a Web developer may want to increase the default text size from 10pt to 12pt for fifty pages of a
            Web site. If the pages all reference the same style sheet, the text size only needs to be changed on the
            style sheet and all the pages will show the larger text.<br>

            While CSS is great for creating text styles, it is helpful for formatting other aspects of Web page layout
            as well. For example, CSS can be used to define the cell padding of table cells, the style, thickness, and
            color of a table's border, and the padding around images or other objects. CSS gives Web developers more
            exact control over how Web pages will look than HTML does. This is why most Web pages today incorporate
            cascading style sheets
        </p>
        <h5><strong>History of CSS</strong></h5>
        <p>
            "Like HTML, CSS is standardized by the W3 consortium. CSS is an open, independent and freely usable
            standard. As with HTML, a working group exists for CSS who concerns itself with development of the standard.
            This is being done in accordance with W3C rules.<br>

            CSS comes in different versions. CSS level 1 was released in 1996, and republished with corections in 1999.
            CSS level 2 appeared in 1998 and built on CSS level 1. CSS level 2 adds support for different output media.
            CSS 3 is currently in development and will be split up in modules.<br>

            The idea behind it was to seperate presentation and content of a web site. The advantage of this approach is
            that updates and changes to the presentation need only be applied once (to the stylesheet) to affect all
            pages. Especially large sites can achieve significant time savings. In order to enforce this separation of
            concerns, the W3C has deprecated the <xmp><font></font></xmp> tag in HTML 4. Newer (X)HTML versions will deprecate other tags
            in a similar vein.
