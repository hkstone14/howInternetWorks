        <h1>Domain Name System</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through
            domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
            DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.<br>

            Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device.
            DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.4 (in IPv4), or more
            complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::d629:c7a2 (in IPv6).
        </p>
        <h5><strong>A Brief History of the DNS</strong></h5>
        <p>
            Thirty years ago, when the Internet was still in its infancy when you wanted to visit a website you had to
            know the IP address of that site. That’s because computers are and were only able to communicate using
            numbers.<br>

            This is an IP address: 127.33.54.200.
            It’s long, hard to remember, and we (humans, I presume) are not robots. We needed a way to translate
            computer-readable information into human-readable. And it had to be fast, lightweight, and scalable.<br>

            In the early 1980’s, Paul Mockapetris came up with a system that automatically mapped IP addresses to domain
            names.. and the DNS was born. This same system still serves as the backbone of the modern Internet, today.
        </p>
        <h5><strong>How DNS works?</strong></h5>
        <p>
            We already know that it maps IP addresses to domain names, but where is this information stored? On
            nameservers!

            Nameservers store DNS records which are the actual file that says “this domain” maps to “this IP address”.
            So is there a room somewhere that has all the nameservers and DNS records for every site on the Internet?
            No… that would be ridiculous.<br>

            They are actually distributed all around the world. These nameservers are called the root nameservers and
            instead of storing every domain ever, they store the locations of the TLD (top level domains).

            TLD’s are the two or three character like .com that end a domain name. Each TLD has their own set of
            nameservers that store the information that says who is authoritative for storing the DNS records for that
            domain.<br>

            The authoritative nameserver is typically the DNS provider or the DNS registrar (like GoDaddy that offers
            both DNS registration and hosting). And here we can find the DNS record that maps example.com to the IP
            address 127.66.122.88.
        </p>
        <h5><strong>Example</strong></h5>
        <p>
            Let's say that you type the URL <strong>www.mywebsite1425.com</strong> into your browser. The browser contacts a DNS server
            to get the IP address. A DNS server would start its search for an IP address by contacting one of the root
            DNS servers. The root servers know the IP addresses for all of the DNS servers that handle the top-level
            domains (.COM, .NET, .ORG, etc.). Your DNS server would ask the root for www.mywebsite1425.com, and the root
            would say, "I don't know the IP address for www.mywebsite1425.com, but here's the IP address for the .COM
            DNS server."<br>

            Your name server then sends a query to the .COM DNS server asking it if it knows the IP address for
            www.mywebsite1425.com. The DNS server for the COM domain knows the IP addresses for the name servers
            handling the www.mywebsite1425.com domain, so it returns those.<br>

            Your name server then contacts the DNS server for www.mywebsite1425.com and asks if it knows the IP address
            for www.mywebsite1425.com. It actually does, so it returns the IP address to your DNS server, which returns
            it to the browser, which can then contact the server for www.mywebsite1425.com to get a Web page.
