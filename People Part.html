        <h1>Internet History-People Part</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>We know what it is as 21st century humans value crave and worship above all else the thing we seek out minute
            by minute 24/7 365 days a year well an idealist might say the answer is love or maybe happiness a cynic
            might say money the power. This is the story of how the world is changing the web this is Silicon Valley
            California and these dudes are Chad Hurley Kevin Rose and Jay Adelson now they may look more like Doogie
            Howser than Che Guevara but these guys are among the leaders of the web 2.0 revolution.</p>

        <p>Rosen a Tolson run Digg social news website the content of which is chosen by its devoted user community of
            millions surely meanwhile is the co-founder of one of the planet's most insanely popular websites YouTube
            the online video sharing service that was bought by Google in 2006 for a jaw-dropping 1.65 billion dollars
            now you might think that like other startup players these guys are in it to get rich and yeah they are but
            they're also on a mission to change the world through web enabled people power.</p>

        <p>This is what the Internet's all about the Internet's about connecting individuals or connecting individuals
            to information who do you trust more do you trust some corporate executive in some smoky filled back room or
            do you trust your peers and the people who are connected to you that sounds like fighting talk that's
            because it is dig and YouTube are part of a new wave of web services each more popular than the last all of
            which offer an alternative to old-school media like the one you're watching right now until very recently
            the old television order operated according to a set of ancient and antiquated customs incredibly
            charismatic and slightly obnoxious guys like me would travel around the world with huge expense accounts and
            even bigger salaries getting ourselves filmed by guys like these for the average person the TV industry was
            impossible to get into.</p>


        <p>It was a clubby system that decided on its own what would get on the air them too in other words but not
            anymore today the TV industry is being blown wide open made accessible to everyone all because of YouTube
            and a transformation summed up by its two-word slogan broadcast yourself before it was just a traditional
            media companies that would control the gates of distribution and also they were controlling what was being
            produced but we think everyone has an opportunity or should have the ability to be heard it's not surprising
            that some of the titans of television find YouTube so threatening especially after its marriage to Google
            but what Chad Hurley and his gang have done is given us all a power they used to reside only in the hands of
            the Masters of big media.</p>

        <p>They've given each and every one of us our own personal broadcast tower from which we can transmit our home
            video creations be they brilliant or utterly moronic to a potential audience of millions over a dig a
            similar kind of experiment is underway only here the subject isn't frivolous TV entertainment but that most
            self-serious of subjects news like a newspaper dig is full of the latest goings-on from around the world
            what lands on digs front-page isn't decided by some stripe be sure to ink stain then Bradley wannabe it's
            decided by you the user the more people who dig which is to say vote for a given story more prominence gets
            on the site you know it's always been a handful of editors that determine what belongs in the front page of
            a newspaper or anywhere else.</p>


        <p>Now it's the entire you know close to a million registered editors that we have that are constantly looking
            for great news information stories videos and anything else to expose to the community what dig is doing is
            it's saying a blog could be on the same plane as the New York Times and it's up to the people to decide
            what's important the guys at both YouTube and Digg are believers and a theory known as the wisdom of crowds
            they're also deeply in touch with the fact that we love nothing more than the sound of our own voices the
            sight of our own images on a screen but there may be nobody who understands all that more deeply at this
            moment than this kid Mark Zuckerberg the 22 year old founder of the burgeoning social networking site
            Facebook the reason why you spend so much time communicating with your with your friends right and other
            people that you respect. They're the direct descendants of another crop of media revolutionaries who hit the
            scene an eternity ago in high-tech terms at which I mean you know a little less than a decade ago today
            we've all become a bit blase about the web we take for granted the huge changes it is caused in our daily
            lives especially when it comes to how we consume media but take a second and cast your mind back to say the
            mid 1990s.</p>
