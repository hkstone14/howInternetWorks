        <h1>HTTP and HTTPS</h1>
        <hr>
        <h5><strong>What is HTTP?</strong></h5>
        <p>
            HTTP is Hypertext transfer protocol. Simply put - Rules to sending and receiving text-based messages. As we
            all know, computers work in a language of 1's and 0's i.e. Binary language. Therefore, potentially every set
            of 1's and 0's construct something, it could be a word.<br>

            Let's say we want to write 'a'. Now, if 0 stands for 'a', 1 stands for 'b', and 01 stands for 'c', we can
            infer that a combination of 0's and 1's can construct a word as well. In this case, the text is already
            constructed and is being sent on the wire. The computer works on many languages - pure binary, text and some
            other formats like byte codes. Here, what is being transferred is text. we are emphasizing on 'text' because
            this text is interpreted by the browser and the moment browser interprets it, it becomes hypertext, and the
            protocol that transfers the text is referred to as hypertext transfer protocol - HTTP.<br>

            Using HTTP, you can definitely transfer images and text and even sound, but not videos.
        </p>
        <h5><strong>What is HTTPS?</strong></h5>
        <p>
            Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is
            sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for
            'Secure'. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted. HTTPS is often
            used to protect highly confidential online transactions like online banking and online shopping order forms.
        </p>
        <h5><strong>What is the importance of HTTPS?</strong></h5>
        <p>
            We agreed upon the fact that what is being transferred from one point to another is text. To understand why
            HTTPS protocol, we first should know how wi-fi routers function.Let's say you are at an airport and you are
            connecting to the wi-fi which is the property of a third party. Now, when you are communicating over HTTP,
            the text is being transferred by their router. And if I go to a low version of the router, I can comfortably
            check and read the text that is being transferred. There could be a password that I can use to login to your
            bank site and do a fraudulent transaction!. Point being - this is fundamentally insecure. This is called the
            man in the middle attack.<br>

            And this why do we need https when HTTP seems to suffice.
